## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Vanilla Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I started this project to review what I learned about Tailwind. I haven't used it in a while so I wanted to refresh my memory. I know It isn't perfect and I couldn't be bothered finishing it and hence it looks quite bad.

I didn't learn much but I learned how to set custom screen sizes.
